This is a quick app to play with SwiftUI, fetching data from a external API (in this case I used [potterapi](https://github.com/fedeperin/potterapi)). 

This is the first "complete" app I've ever created in iOS and I loved how simple SwiftUI makes it to quickly get up and running with some simple and responsive screens.
